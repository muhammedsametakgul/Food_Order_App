<h1>Libraries and Technologies Used</h1>

[Architecture][3]: XML architecture is a descriptive language that is utilized to establish the framework and information of various types of data. When it comes to developing Android applications, XML files are frequently employed to define the layout of user interface components and resources in a hierarchical arrangement

[Viewbinding][4]: View binding is a feature that makes it easier to write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.

[Databinding][5]: The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically

[Recyclerview][6]: RecyclerView is a flexible and efficient view group for displaying large sets of data in an Android app.

[Glide][7]: Glide is an open-source image loading and caching library for Android apps that provides a fast and efficient way to load images from various sources such as remote URLs, local storage, or media providers

[Picasso][8]: A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android

[Lottie][9]: Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile!

[MVVM][10]: MVVM is a software architecture pattern used in Kotlin and other programming languages for designing user interfaces that separates the presentation logic from the business logic.

[Viewmodel][11]: ViewModel is a class in Kotlin that is designed to store and manage UI-related data and state across configuration changes in Android app development.

[Navigation Companent][12]: Navigation Component is a library in Kotlin for Android app development that simplifies the implementation of navigation between screens and app destinations.

[Livedata][13]: LiveData is a data holder class in Kotlin that is part of the Android Architecture Components and is designed to provide observable and lifecycle-aware data updates to an Android app's UI components.

[Room][14]: Room is a persistence library in Kotlin for Android app development that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to easily manage and access a SQLite database.

[Retrofit][15]: Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.

[Firebase Authentication][1]: Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

[Firebase Realtime Database][2]: Store and sync data with our NoSQL cloud database. Data is synced across all clients in realtime, and remains available when your app goes offline
